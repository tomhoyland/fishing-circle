**What is it?**

The Fishing Circle is a simple and easy-to-adopt tool for facilitators and groups to use during meetings, workshops, events and discussions to navigate a topic or outcome, whilst maintaining focus and relevance. 
The tool comprises four circles:
1. **Topic or Outcome** - The topic or the outcome of the event, workshop, or discussion taking place. This should be easily definable, understood and agreed with/by participants.
2. **Facts and Insight** - What facts, data, information, insights, experiences and stories are relevant to the Topic or Outcome?
3. **Options and Ideas** - Based on what we know and don't know, what next steps exist, what will, could or should happen next in support of the Topic or Outcome.
4. **Outer Ring** - Whilst they are _technically_ a fourth circle, **Loud** and **Quiet**, **Same** and **Different** are prompts for facilitators and participants to consider different voices and perspectives that might not be immediately apparent as Facts and Insights and Options and Ideas are being explored.



**Why is it useful?**

The Fishing Circle is intended to be extensible. 
- It's small enough to fit in your head to help you navigate, ask questions and surface the collective intelligence of a group. 
- It's simple enough to convey to another person on a Post-It Note. 
- It's easy to scale up to be used visually on a poster/canvas with Post-It Notes to invite interaction and participation during workshops, events and discussions.

Are you facilitating an event in person? The Fishing Circle works well when participants are in the same space. Facilitating remotely? The Fishing Circle works great remotely too using your favourite remote collaboration tool.



**Who is it for?**

People who work with people and groups of people. Facilitators, Coaches, Scrum Masters, Delivery Managers, Software Engineers, Business Analysts, Project Managers etc. 



**When to use it**

The Fishing Circle can be used to frame, navigate and facilitate a whole discussion, deployed mid-way through a workshop or event once a Topic or Outcome has been aligned, or wherever a facilitator thinks it might add value. It's intended to work with and complement other tools, methods and approaches e.g. a Fishing Circle is used in a group problem-solving workshop to reach a point where Options and Ideas are made visible, which are then selected and defined in further detail through a Movement-to-Action method, articulating What, Why, How, When and Who.



**How to use it**

When facilitating a meeting, workshop or discussion, a lot of information and options can be surfaced. Some of it relevant to the Topic or Outcome of that event, and some of it not so relevant. The Fishing Circle is a small facilitation tool to help facilitators and participants navigate and explore a topic, by surfacing data, information, experience and insights from participants, and continuously linking this back to the Topic or Outcome to maintain focus and relevancy. Once a Topic or Outcome has been understood with surrounding Facts and Insights surfaced, facilitators and participants expand conversations further to explore what could happen next, discussing Options and Ideas. As Options and Ideas are surfaced and explored, these are continuously linked back to supporting Facts and Insights, and then back further to the Topic of Outcome to maintain focus and relevance. 

The Fishing Circle is a simple tool for facilitators and participants that can help to prompt clarifications and curiosity during events, whilst revealing new information, e.g.
- _"How is that Insight related/relevant/linked to the Topic or Outcome?"_
- _"...and you're suggesting this is an Option based on this Fact?"_
- _"Is that an Idea we want to explore right now, as we are here to discuss this Topic"_ 



**Quick Start Guide**

1. Begin with your Topic or Outcome, verifying and confirming agreement with participants.
2. Gather Facts and Insights from participants, tracking these back to the Topic or Outcome. If you’ve got enough information here, expand out further…
3. Begin to gather Ideas and Options, tracking these back to previous Facts and Insights, and ultimately the Topic or Outcome to keep conversations focused and relevant. If you’ve got enough, stop.
4. With what you have, converge and conclude on what it means and what should happen next, using your own style or approach, returning to confirm with participants the Topic or Outcome has been met. This could be concluding a discussion, or moving to clearly define and select the next steps as a move to action. 

As you gather Facts and Insights, Ideas and Options consider what is happening in the space. Are there Loud voices and groups who are Quiet? If there are, consider ways to bring other voices to the surface. Is what is being surfaced similar or the Same? If so, consider checking for Different viewpoints.



**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Why is it called a Fishing Circle? 

A: From an agreed starting Topic or Outcome, a facilitator and group cast out a fishing line, drawing back in relevant and related Facts and Insights. When ready, they cast the fishing line out further to Options and Ideas, bringing these back to support the Topic or Outcome of the event or discussion. 


Q: Should a facilitator remain in the Centre of the Circle and do all the Fishing?

A: No. The Fishing Circle is intended to help frame and navigate, encouraging focus and relevance for a Topic or Outcome. Whilst a facilitator can bring skills to a discussion, workshop, or event to surface the 'collective intelligence' of a group, facilitators are encouraged to create a space for groups and participants to self-manage in the pursuit of an outcome. Where the Fishing Circle has been used effectively, group participants use the tool to collectively navigate, reaching out for more information, and using it to invite curiosity over relevance and maintaining focus. 


Q: What if you find a big fact or 'big fish' that causes a Topic or Outcome to become imbalanced, focused on a specific point, or drawn away from the original Topic or Outcome? 

A: That kind of stuff will happen when facilitating. As a facilitator, reflect what you are noticing to participants, and how this might impact the Topic or Outcome. Is the Topic or Outcome still valid? Is it too broad? Should it change? If you and/or the participants realise a Topic or Outcome needs to be revised or changed to reach the best outcome, don't be afraid to return to the centre of the Fishing Circle and change this with the agreement of the participants.
