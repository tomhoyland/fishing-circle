**What is it?**

The Fishing Circle is a simple and easy-to-adopt tool for facilitators and groups to use during meetings, workshops, events and discussions to navigate a topic or goal, whilst maintaining focus and relevance. 
The tool comprises of 3 circles:
1. **Topic or Goal** - The topic or the goal of the event, workshop, or discussion taking place. This should be easily definable, understood and agreed with/by participants.
2. **Facts and Insight** - What facts, data, information, insights, experiences and stories are relevant to the Topic or Goal?
3. **Options and Ideas** - Based on what we know and don't know, what next steps exist, what will, could or should happen next in support of the Topic or Goal.


**Why is it useful?**

The Fishing Circle is intended to be extensible. 
- It's small enough to fit in your head to help you navigate, ask questions and surface the collective intelligence of a group. 
- It's simple enough to convey to another person on a Post-It Note. 
- It's easy to scale up to be used visually on a poster/canvas with Post-It Notes to invite interaction and participation during workshops, events and discussions. 


**How to use it**

When facilitating a meeting, workshop or discussion, a lot of information and options can be surfaced. Some of it relevant to the Topic or Goal of that event, and some of it not so relevant. The Fishing Circle is a small facilitation tool to help facilitators and participants navigate and explore a topic, by surfacing data, information, experience and insights from participants, and continuously linking this back to the Topic or Goal to maintain focus and relevancy. Once a Topic or Goal has been understood with surrounding Facts and Insights surfaced, facilitators and participants expand conversations further to explore what could happen next, discussing Options and Ideas. As Options and Ideas are surfaced and explored, these are continuously linked back to supporting Facts and Insights, and then back further to the Topic of Goal to maintain focus and relevance. 

The Fishing Circle is a simple tool for facilitators and participants that can help to prompt clarifications and curiosity during events, whilst revealing new information, e.g.
- _"How is that Insight related/relevant/linked to the Topic or Goal?"_
- _"...and you're suggesting this is an Option based on this Fact?"_
- _"Is that an Idea we want to explore right now, as we are here to discuss this Topic"_



**Quick Start Guide**

1. Begin with your Topic or Goal, confirming agreement with participants.
2. Gather Facts and Insights from participants, tracking these back to the Topic or Goal. If you’ve got enough information here, expand out further…
3. Begin to gather Ideas and Options, tracking these back to previous Facts and Insights, and ultimately the Topic or Goal to keep conversations focused and relevant. If you’ve got enough, stop.
4. With what you have, converge and conclude on what it means and what should happen next, using your own style or approach, returning to confirm with participants the Topic or Goal has been met.



**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: Why is it called a Fishing Circle? 

A: From an agreed starting Topic or Goal, a facilitator and group cast out a fishing line, drawing back in relevant and related Facts and Insights. When ready, they cast the fishing line out further to Options and Ideas, bringing these back to support the Topic or Goal of the event or discussion.
